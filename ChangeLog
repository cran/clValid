Version: 0.6-1
Date: 2010-11-05

	* Changed format for reading biological annotation files from
	Excel 2003/2007 to comma separated
	
	* Split R code into four files: clValid-Classes.R,
	clValid-Methods.R, clValid-internal.R, clValid-functions.R

-------------------
Version: 0.6
Date: 2009-11-17

	* matchGO : Made change to identify annotated probes with
	category="all" argument.
	
	* clValid : Missing values are now allowed in clValid().  For the
	correlation metric the use="pairwise.complete.obs" option is used,
	while the na.rm=TRUE option is used when calculating means for the
	AD and ADM measures.

	* annotationListToMatrix : Added new function to convert annotation
	lists to TRUE/FALSE logical matrices: columns = functional
	classes, rows = genes

	* readAnnotationFile : Added function to read biological
	annotation file from Excel spreadsheet

	* getRanksWeights : Added function to obtain ranks and weights
	for rank aggregation from clValid object
		
	* BSI, BHI : Changed functions to work with TRUE/FALSES matrices
	from annotateListToMatrix (thanks to Rainer Machne for suggestion)

	* sota : History of diversities for ancestor nodes are now stored.

	* sota : Moved break for maxDiversity with unrest.growth==FALSE to
	occur at same point as break for maxCycles (thanks to Rainer
	Machne)
	
	* clValid : Added argument 'verbose' to track pecentage completion
	of cluster validation 
	
	* clValid : Now attempts automatic download and installation of
	Bioconductor annotation packages if not currently installed

	* clValid-class : Added slot 'labels' to contain the 
	character vector giving the item (gene) labels.	
	
	* clValid, BHI, BSI : Updated to use package GO.db instead of
	defunct GO package.  Also, added argument 'dropEvidence' to select
	type of GO evidence used.

	* Packages RankAggreg and RODBC added to list of recommended
	packages

	* Packages kohonen and mclust changed from required to recommended
	list of packages

	* Packages GO and moe430 removed from list of recommend packages,
	added packages GO.db and moe430a.db
	
	* Vignette updated to include example of rank aggregation using
	package RankAggreg, and also illustrates usage of 'dropEvidence'
	argument and reading in biological annotation files using
	Excel 

-------------------
Version: 0.5-7
Date: 2008-07-28

	* Added latex style file and made minor changes to clValid-class.Rd

-------------------
Version: 0.5-6
Date: 2008-01-27

	* sota, sota.print, sota.plot : Fixed these to print and plot properly
	when actual number of clusters is fewer than requested number
	(i.e. some clusters are not populated)

	* Added fixes to catch cases where fewer than requested number of
	clusters is returned by clustering method.  A warning message is
	given when this occurs.

-------------------
Version: 0.5-4
Date: 2007-12-14
	
	* The default titles for plotting the validation measures were
	changed to "Internal validation", "Stability validation", and
	"Biological validation" for internal, stability, and biological
	validation, respectively.

	* The functions for calculating each validation measure: dunn,
	connectivity, BHI, BSI, stability; and the internal function
	matchGO are all exported now.  Users can call these directly if
	they have an external clustering algorithm they want to evaluate,
	or if they just have a dissimilarity matrix (though the original
	data matrix is still required for the stability measures APN,
	AD, ADM, and BSI).

	* clValid : Now accepts data frames w/integer data

	* clValid : Attempts to automatically install Bioconductor
	metadata packages if they are not currently available 

	* clValid : A new argument 'maxitems' was added to limit the
	number of clustered items.  If R is being used interactively and
	'maxitems' is exceeded, the user is prompted about whether to
	continue.  If R is not being used interactively the function exits
	with an error message.  

	* clValid : Accepts ExpressionSet objects rather than the now
	defunct exprSet objects
